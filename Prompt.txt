Create a web-based hand gesture controlled game called "Wind Master" where players use their hand movements to control wind in a 3D environment. 

Requirements:

1. Use MediaPipe Hands for real-time hand tracking
2. Use Three.js for 3D graphics with a serene natural landscape (rolling hills, trees, grass)
3. Implement these gesture controls:
   - Open palm with TILT: Rotate palm left/right to control wind direction horizontally (like steering)
   - Open palm UP/DOWN: Move hand vertically to control wind up/down
   - Closed fist + CIRCULAR motion: Create a vortex/tornado effect
4. Add 2000+ wind particles that respond to wind direction and vortex
5. Make trees bend and sway based on wind direction and vortex intensity
6. Show a stickman visualization of the hand pose in the top-right corner
7. Display current gesture state in the UI
8. Add dynamic wind sound effects:
   - Normal wind: filtered white noise that changes pitch/volume with wind strength
   - Vortex: deep rumbling sound with frequency modulation
9. Include a tutorial overlay that explains the controls
10. Use a Chinese-inspired aesthetic with calligraphy-style fonts and minimalist design
11. Make the controls less sensitive - wind strength should be moderate, not overpowering
